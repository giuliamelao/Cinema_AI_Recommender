# Cinema AI Recommender 🤖🎞️

## Welcome to Cinema AI Recommender, a Machine Learning recommendation system exclusively tailored for film enthusiasts

This project focus on predictive analysis of movie preferences.

#### How It Works:

The process? Simple. We sample data, create a specialized matrix, apply SVD factorization, and voilà—predicting user ratings. [Collaborative filtering](https://realpython.com/build-recommendation-engine-collaborative-filtering/) reveals hidden preferences, making your movie choices uniquely yours. 🎬✨

The dataset used for the training was gathered on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evanschreiner/netflix-movie-ratings/).
